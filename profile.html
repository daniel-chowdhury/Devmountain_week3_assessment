	Hello and welcome to my profile page. I was born in Bangladesh during 1985 and immigrated to the United States during 1999. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia during high school years and went to Chamblee High School. While in High School, I used to enjoy playing video games, doing exercise, and going to the movies. I went to college at Georgia Tech and graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering during 2010.
